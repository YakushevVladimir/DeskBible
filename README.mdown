This app is the mobile version of a desktop program called "BibleQuote", which is known among Windows users. This Android app will eventually support all Bible translations and books which were developed as modules for the desktop BibleQuote, Bible cross-references. Almost all modules can be used right now. At the moment some modules with special fonts are not supported yet. We also have plans to add dictionaries and Strongs lexicon support. We also plan to support user notes.
You can also take a tour to the news&support website at <http://scripturesoftware.org>!

A sample application can be downloaded on the [Google Play][google_play]
